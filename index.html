    <p class="card-text">focuses on individuals and organizations to examine culture and recognize continual learning as practitioners from other cultures and that we do not know everything and need to learn from the client.

Cultural humility often encompasses self-reflection and personal critique and is an ongoing, lifelong process.</p>
